## Traffic Segue Project
Very basic project where I explored changing the background scene with events such as button clicks as well a pop fucntions

## Loan Calculator Project
This is work in progess. The goal is to allow the user to input their student or other loan information
and use a slider to see how adjustments in payment amount impact total interest and amount paid as well as
the time it will take to payoff the lone. This would allow the user to see how even relatively small increases
in monthly payment amounts can lead to larger savings down the road.
